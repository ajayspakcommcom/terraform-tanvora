  Summary in Simple Words (VPC)
     A VPC is like your private office building in AWS.
     Rooms = Subnets
     Doors = Gateways (IGW/NAT)
     Security Guards = Security Groups/NACLs
     Address system = CIDR ranges


  Simple Analogy (Subnets)
👉  Imagine your VPC = a big apartment complex 🏢
    Subnets = different floors or sections (Public = lobby, Private = locked office areas).
    Public area → visitors can come in (via IGW).
    Private area → only staff with access can go in (via NAT).


✅Analogy (Internet Gateway)
👉 Imagine your VPC = a house 🏠
   The Internet Gateway = the main front door 🚪.
   Public subnet servers are like rooms with windows open to the street.
   Private subnet servers live in the basement — they need someone (NAT) to fetch things for them outside.

   Analogy (Egress Only Internet Gateways)
      Imagine your private subnet = a library reading room.
      Egress-Only IGW = a one-way door → people inside can step out, but nobody from outside can step in.
      It’s like going out to buy books (outbound), but strangers can’t walk into the library from outside (no inbound).


   Super Simple Analogy (DHCP Options Sets) (need to know more about this service)
👉    Think of DHCP Option Set as the default Wi-Fi settings for your VPC:
      When you connect your laptop to Wi-Fi, it automatically knows:
      The Wi-Fi name (domain).
      Which DNS to use to reach the internet.
      What time server to use.


   Simple Analogy
👉   Imagine your EC2 = a house 🏠
     A normal public IP is like a phone number that changes every time you move.
     An Elastic IP is like buying a permanent phone number 📞 — no matter where you move, people can always reach you at the same number.

   When to Use
     You need a permanent, public-facing IP.
     You want high availability (can quickly move IP to another instance).
     You’re hosting production web apps, NAT gateways, or SSH bastion hosts.
