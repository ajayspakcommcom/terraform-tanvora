# notes
# Whatâ€™s Typically Added Later (if needed)
# What remains (MNC best practices):
# ðŸ”¹ VPC Endpoints (S3, DynamoDB, ECR, Secrets Manager)
# ðŸ”¹ Security Groups (for EC2, ALB, DB)
# ðŸ”¹ Network ACLs (optional, extra compliance)
# ðŸ”¹ Flow Logs â†’ CloudWatch/S3
# ðŸ”¹ Bastion Host / VPN / Direct Connect (secure access)
# ðŸ”¹ VPC Peering / Transit Gateway (multi-VPC setups)
# ðŸ”¹ IPv6 support (dual-stack networks)
# ðŸ”¹ Strict tagging policy
